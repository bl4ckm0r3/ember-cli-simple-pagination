```js
{{simple-pagination totalResults=86}}
```

```js
{{simple-pagination currentPage=13 totalResults=86}}
```

## Block mode
The component can be used in block mode, in that case it won't be rendereing it's own components but only yielding
```hbs
{{#simple-pagination totalResults=totalResults as |p|}}
  <p>{{p.currentPage}}</p>
  <p>{{p.totalPages}}</p>
  <div>
    {{#each p.range as |item|}}
      <button {{action p.onPage item}}>{{item}}</button>
    {{/each}}
  </div>
  <button {{action p.onNext}}>onNext</button>
  <button {{action p.onPrevious}}>onPrevious</button>
{{/simple-pagination}}
```
